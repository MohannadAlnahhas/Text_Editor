# Text_Editor

This is a simple text editor programmed by java. <br>
I programmed this editor as required from one of the assignments my instructor gave to us in a course called "Data structures and algorithms" in 28/03/2020. <br><br>

The program has a class called "ProgramTest", which takes an input .txt file name (this is the main class you should use). <br>
If there is a .txt file with the same input name given; it will open it giving the user the ability to edit the file. <br>
Else if the .txt file doesn't exist; it will make a new empty file in which the user can start editing. <br>
Else if there is not given .txt file name, it will also create a new file where the user has to specify the name later when saving it. <br><br>

The commands that the program can do: <br>
1- Appending new lines after the last line. <br>
2- Deleting lines. <br>
3- Editing characters ( a cursor will appear to replace, delete, or add a new character in the current line). <br>
4- Jumping to a given line number. <br>
5- Searching for a given word. <br>
6- Printing commands list ( what and how to use the commands). <br>
7- Displaying the whole document by printing the lines. <br>
8- Saving the edited file to a .txt file. <br>
9- Creating a report (as .txt file) that has all the words in the document and how many times it occurred. <br><br>

Feature 9 may take some time if the document is large.
